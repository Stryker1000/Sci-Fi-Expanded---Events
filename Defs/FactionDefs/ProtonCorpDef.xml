        <description>A group of outcasts mostly composed of glitterworld soldiers and researchers. Although they initially started off as a ragtag group of misfits, their new technology soon made them a force to be reckoned with all across the galaxy. They don't have many bases on a distant rimworld such as this one. Still, they could be an extremely helpful ally, or a dangerous enemy.</description>
